I am a second-year Ph.D student at The University of Manchester, supervised by [Prof. Chenghua Lin](https://chenghualin.wordpress.com/). My research area mainly focus on Natural Language Processing, especially the Natural Language Generation, including Dialogue generation and evaluation, Table understanding and LLM.
